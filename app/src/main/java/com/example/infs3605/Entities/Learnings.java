These songs often describe how the features of the land were created and named during the Dreamtime. By singing the songs in the appropriate order, Aboriginal Australians could navigate vast distances, often travelling through the deserts of Australia's interior. They relate the holder or the keeper of the song or Dreamtime story with an inherent obligation and reciprocity with the land.", "https://teachik.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/skjermbilde-2017-01-22-kl-16-59-30.png?w=640", 11));
